Algorithm 3: Print students list with total mark less than a certain threshold given by user as input

Function filterThreshold:
	Prompt user with "Please provide threshold:" 
	Take input from user and store in markthreshold
	//Print message that clarify filtering process
	Print "List of students with total marks less than threshold " + markthreshold 
	//flag to trace if any students meet criteria
	Initialize dataFound as false 

	For each student in studentList Do: // Loop through each student 
		Get students total mark using student.getTotalMarks()
		//Check if student's total marks is less than given threshold
		If student.getTotalMarks() < markthreshold then: 
			Print the student's details
			Set dataFound to true //Set flag to true as student met condition
		End If
	End For
	If dataFound is false then:
		Print "No student with total marks less than " + markthreshold //Print no result found message

	End If
End Function

Algorithm 4: Print top 5 students with highest and lowest total marks

Step 1: Bubble Sort Students by Total Marks

Function bubbleSortStudents:
	Set n to size of studentList 
	//Outer loop for the bubble sort algorithm
	For i = 0 To n - 2 Do: 
	// Inner loop to compare marks
		For j = 0 TO n - i - 2 Do:
		//Check if current student marks is greater than next student's marks
			If studentList[j].getTotalMarks() > studentList[j+1].getTotalMarks() Then:
				// Swap students if true
				Set temp to studentList[j]
				Set studentList[j] To studentList[j + 1]
				Set studentList[j + 1] to temp
			End If
		End For
	End For
End Function

		

Output: StudentList sorted in ascending order by totalMarks

Step 2: Print Top 5 Students with highest and lowest marks
Function printTopBottomStudents:
	//Call bubble sort function to sort student by total marks
	CALL bubbleSortStudents()
	Print "Top 5 Students with highest marks :".
	//Loop through last 5 student in list sorted
	For i = 0 to 4:
		PRINT studentList[size of studentList - 1 - i]
	End For

Step 3: Print Bottom 5 Students with lowest marks

	Print "Bottom 5 Students with lowest marks:".
	//Loop through first 5 student in list sorted
	For i = 0 to 4:
		Print details of studentList[i].
	End For
End Function
