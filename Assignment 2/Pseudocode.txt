Algorithm 3: Print students list with total mark less than a certain threshold given by user as input

Function filterThreshold(studentList):
Prompt user with "Please provide threshold:"
Take input from user and store in markthreshold
Print "List of students with total marks less than threshold " + markthreshold
Initialize dataFound as false

	For each student in studentList:
		Get the students total marks using student.getTotalMarks()
		If student.getTotalMarks() is less than markthreshold then:
			Print the student's details
			Set dataFound to true
		End If
	End For
	If dataFound is false then:
		Print "No student with total marks less than " + markthreshold
End Function
